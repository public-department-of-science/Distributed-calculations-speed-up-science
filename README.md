# Distributed-calculations-speed-up-science
Here will be placed information, implementation and many other things I already work on and will work on some new - to speed up science experiments calculations. Do you remember magnetic cards? - I don't, but I worked on HDD+1.4Hz and 2Gb Ram. It was hard to even run my PC, not speaking about calculation smth more complex than 2+2. If we have now more powerful PCs why we shouldn't calculate even faster than before if we really need that? - Especially, single science-engineers like me who want to perform that almost for free or for acceptible price.
